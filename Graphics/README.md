- `Graphics/tests/Unit/` - Unit tests for all components

## Async Disposal & Resource Management

The Graphics library implements modern async disposal patterns to efficiently handle large image metadata:

### Key Features
- **IAsyncDisposable Implementation**: All image classes and metadata implement `IAsyncDisposable` for non-blocking resource cleanup
- **Interface Hierarchy**: `IMetadata` base interface provides disposable patterns for all metadata types
- **Intelligent Thresholds**: Automatic detection of large metadata (>1MB) for optimized disposal strategies
- **Batched Operations**: Large metadata collections are cleared in batches with `Task.Yield()` for responsiveness
- **Standardized Constants**: Centralized configuration through `ImageConstants` class

### Disposal Strategies
- **Small Metadata (<1MB)**: Synchronous disposal for optimal performance
- **Large Metadata (>1MB)**: Asynchronous disposal with yielding to avoid blocking
- **Very Large Metadata (>10MB)**: Includes explicit garbage collection suggestions

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Image Processing
```csharp
await using var image = new TiffRaster(width, height);
// Large metadata operations...
// Automatic async disposal when exiting scope
```

#### Working with Metadata
```csharp
// Raster metadata
IRasterMetadata rasterMeta = image.Metadata;
rasterMeta.Width = 1920;
rasterMeta.Height = 1080;

// Vector metadata (custom implementations)
IVectorMetadata vectorMeta = vectorGraphic.Metadata;
// Vector-specific metadata operations
```
