## Wangkanai Graphics

This module provides a set of classes and interfaces for drawing shapes, lines, and other graphical elements in a 2D space.
It is designed to be used in conjunction with the Wangkanai Planet framework to create visual representations of data or user interfaces.

We need a high-performance image manipulation tool that utilizes parallel CPU and GPU, and is cross-platform.

### Features

- **Raster**: [Support for raster graphics, including pixel manipulation and image processing](https://github.com/wangkanai/planet/issues/49)
- **Vector**: [Support for vector graphics, allowing for scalable shapes and lines](https://github.com/wangkanai/planet/issues/51)
