# Scope Clarity & Future Development Strategy

## üéØ Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ **Architectural Clarity: EXCELLENT**

Your architecture is **exceptionally well-defined** with:

- Clear component boundaries and responsibilities
- Proper dependency relationships
- Comprehensive format and protocol support
- Modern technology stack (.NET 9.0, Blazor hybrid)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implementation Clarity: NEEDS FOCUS**

The main challenge is **scope prioritization** rather than architectural design.

## üöÄ Strategic Recommendations

### 1. **Create Implementation Decision Matrix**

| Component            | Business Value  | Technical Complexity | Dependencies      | Priority |
|----------------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Spatial.Root**     | üî• Critical     | ‚≠ê Low                | None              | **P0**   |
| **Graphics.Rasters** | üî• Critical     | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium            | Abstractions      | **P0**   |
| **Engine.Console**   | üî• Critical     | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium            | Spatial, Graphics | **P0**   |
| **Portal.Server**    | üî• Critical     | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê High             | Identity, EF Core | **P1**   |
| **Protocols.WMS**    | üìà High         | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê High             | Spatial, Graphics | **P1**   |
| **Providers.Bing**   | üìä Medium       | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium            | Protocols         | **P2**   |
| **GPU Acceleration** | üöÄ Nice-to-have | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Very High       | ILGPU             | **P3**   |

### 2. **Define Success Milestones**

#### **Milestone 1: MVP (Month 3)**

**Success Criteria:**

```bash
# This should work perfectly:
tiler process --input sample.tiff --output tiles.mbtiles
# Portal should display the tiles correctly
# Basic authentication should work
```

#### **Milestone 2: Production Beta (Month 6)**

**Success Criteria:**

```bash
# Full workflow should work:
curl "http://localhost/wms?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetMap&LAYERS=layer1&BBOX=-180,-90,180,90&WIDTH=512&HEIGHT=512&FORMAT=image/png"
# Admin portal should manage users and layers
# Performance should handle 10GB+ inputs
```

#### **Milestone 3: Commercial Ready (Month 9)**

**Success Criteria:**

- Multiple concurrent users
- GPU acceleration for large datasets
- Complete protocol compliance
- Production deployment tools

## üìã Scope Clarification Actions

### **Immediate Actions (This Week)**

1. **Create Feature Specification Documents**
   ```markdown
   # Each component needs:
   - Input/Output specifications
   - Performance requirements
   - API contracts
   - Test scenarios
   ```

2. **Establish Development Standards**
   ```csharp
   // Code standards document with:
   - Coding conventions
   - Testing requirements
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Documentation standards
   ```

3. **Set Up Project Tracking**
   ```yaml
   # GitHub Projects setup:
   - Epic: Core Foundation
     - Story: Spatial coordinate transformations
     - Story: TIFF reading capabilities
     - Story: Basic tile generation
   ```

### **Weekly Development Rhythm**

#### **Monday: Architecture Review**

- Review completed components
- Validate against specifications
- Update dependency matrix

#### **Wednesday: Progress Checkpoint**

- Demo working features
- Identify blockers
- Adjust priorities if needed

#### **Friday: Quality Gates**

- Run full test suites
- Performance benchmark validation
- Code review completion

## üîç Missing Clarity Areas to Address

### 1. **Performance Requirements**

**Need to Define:**

- Maximum input file sizes to support
- Acceptable processing times per GB
- Memory usage constraints
- Concurrent user limits

**Recommendation:**

```yaml
Performance Targets:
	InputFiles:
		-   Maximum: 50GB GeoTIFF
		-   Processing: <30 minutes for 10GB
	Memory:
		-   Peak usage: <8GB for large files
		-   Baseline: <500MB idle
	Concurrency:
		-   MVP: 5 concurrent users
		-   Production: 50+ concurrent users
```

### 2. **Deployment Architecture**

**Need to Define:**

- Container orchestration strategy
- Database scaling approach
- Tile storage architecture
- CDN integration points

**Recommendation:**

```dockerfile
# Container strategy:
- planet-engine:latest     # Processing service
- planet-portal:latest     # Web application
- planet-protocols:latest  # Protocol services
```

### 3. **Integration Boundaries**

**Need to Clarify:**

- External service dependencies
- API versioning strategy
- Migration paths for data formats
- Backward compatibility guarantees

## üéØ Decision Framework for Future Features

### **Feature Evaluation Criteria**

1. **User Impact Score (1-5)**
	- Does this solve a real user problem?
	- How many users benefit?

2. **Technical Alignment Score (1-5)**
	- Fits with current architecture?
	- Leverages existing investments?

3. **Implementation Cost Score (1-5)**
	- Development effort required
	- Testing and validation effort

4. **Maintenance Burden Score (1-5)**
	- Ongoing support requirements
	- Complexity added to system

### **Decision Matrix Example**

```
Feature: GPU Acceleration
- User Impact: 4 (significant performance improvement)
- Technical Alignment: 3 (new dependency, but fits architecture)
- Implementation Cost: 5 (high complexity)
- Maintenance Burden: 4 (adds complexity)
Total Score: 16/20 ‚Üí Evaluate for Phase 3
```

## üöß Risk Mitigation Strategy

### **Technical Risks**

- **Large File Processing:** Implement streaming and chunking early
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Continuous testing on all targets
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Profile and benchmark from day one

### **Scope Risks**

- **Feature Creep:** Stick to milestone success criteria
- **Over-Engineering:** Start simple, add complexity when needed
- **Technology Churn:** Lock dependency versions, planned upgrade cycles

### **Resource Risks**

- **Development Capacity:** Clear priority matrix prevents overcommitment
- **Knowledge Transfer:** Comprehensive documentation and code reviews
- **Technical Debt:** Regular refactoring scheduled in each phase

## üéâ Success Indicators

You'll know you have **clear scope** when:

‚úÖ **Any team member can answer:** "What are we building in the next 2 weeks?"

‚úÖ **Clear definition of done** for each component

‚úÖ **Measurable success criteria** for each milestone

‚úÖ **Predictable development velocity** with minimal scope changes

‚úÖ **Stakeholder alignment** on priorities and trade-offs

Your architectural foundation is **excellent**. The focus now should be on **execution clarity** and **incremental
delivery** of working software.
